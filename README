DESCRIPTION
    Nico Nico Douga (ニコニコ動画, lit. "Smile Videos") is a popular
    video sharing website in Japan managed by Niwango, a subsidiary of
    Dwango.

    A Distribution Net-NicoVideo is Perl Interface for accessing Nico Nico
    Douga. This provides the consistent access method, and contents are
    encapsulated and give facilities to clients.

    Net::NicoVideo, instance of this class, is an utility that actually uses
    agent Net::NicoVideo::UserAgent. Therefore we can also use
    Net::NicoVideo::UserAgent to tackle the low level problems.

CONSTRUCTOR
        my $nnv = Net::NicoVideo->new({
            user_agent  => LWP::UserAgent->new,
            email       => 'your-nicovideo@email.address',
            password    => 'and-password',
            delay       => 1,
            });

ACCESS METHOD
  user_agent
    Get or set user agent that $nnv would access to Nico Nico Video via
    HTTP(s).

        $nnv->user_agent($ua);
        $ua = $nnv->user_agent;

  email

        $nnv->email($email);
        $email = $nnv->email;

        $nnv->password($password);
        $password = $nnv->password;

  delay
    Get or set delay seconds.

        $nnv->delay($seconds);
        $seconds = $nnv->delay;

  get_user_agent
    Create an instance of Net::NicoVideo::UserAgent that includes
    $nnv->user_agent has. If it does not have then LWP::UserAgent would be
    created.

  get_email
    Get email that the instance has. If it is not defined,
    $ENV{NET_NICOVIDEO_EMAIL} is returned instead.

  get_password
    Get password that the instance has. If it is not defined,
    $ENV{NET_NICOVIDEO_PASSWORD} is returned instead.

FETCH METHOD
    Each methods return Net::NicoVideo::Content class which stored the
    result of having parsed the response. Please see sub classes under
    Net::NicoVideo::Content for detail.

  fetch_thumbinfo(video_id)
    Get an instance of Net::NicoVideo::Content::ThumbInfo for video_id.

  fetch_flv(video_id)
    Get an instance of Net::NicoVideo::Content::Flv for video_id.

    Get an instance of Net::NicoVideo::Content::Mylist for mylist_id.

  fetch_watch(video_id)
    Get an instance of Net::NicoVideo::Content::Watch for video_id.

    This means that the agent watches the video, and this behavior is
    required before fetch_video.

  fetch_video(video_id, @args)
  fetch_video(flv, @args)
  fetch_video(url, @args)
    Get an instance of Net::NicoVideo::Content::Video for video_id, flv or
    url.

    The url is value getting via $flv->url, and $flv is a
    Net::NicoVideo::Content::Flv which is created by $nnv->fetch_flv.

    The second parameter, it works like as request() method of
    LWP::UserAgent, in fact, it is called. An example, if it is a scalar
    value then it means that the file path to store contents.

UTILITY METHOD
  download(video_id, file)
    This is a shortcut to download video that is identified by video_id.

    For busy person, you can download a video by one liner like this:

        $ perl -MNet::NicoVideo -e 'Net::NicoVideo->new->download(@ARGV)' \
            smNNNNNN ./smile.mp4

    Note that it is necessary to set environment variables in advance.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
        NET_NICOVIDEO_EMAIL
        NET_NICOVIDEO_PASSWORD

    These obvious environment variables are effective. If the object has
    each value as its members, priority is given to them.
