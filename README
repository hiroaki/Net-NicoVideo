        use Net::NicoVideo;

        my $video_id = $ARGV[0] or die;

        my $nnv = Net::NicoVideo->new({
            email    => 'your-nicovideo@email.address',
            password => 'and-password',
            });

        my $info = $nnv->fetch_thumbinfo( $video_id );
        my $flv  = $nnv->fetch_flv( $video_id );

        printf "download: %s\n". $info->title;
        if( $flv->is_economy ){
            warn "now economy time, skip\n";
        }else{
            my $save_path = sprintf '%s/Movies/%s.%s',
                $ENV{HOME}, $video_id, $info->movie_type;
    
            $nnv->watch_video( $video_id );
            $nnv->fetch_video( $flv, $save_path );
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Nico Nico Douga (ニコニコ動画, lit. "Smile Videos") is a popular
    video sharing website in Japan managed by Niwango, a subsidiary of
    Dwango.

    A Distribution Net-NicoVideo is Perl Interface for accessing Nico Nico
    Douga. This provides the consistent access method, and contents are
    encapsulated and give facilities to clients.

    Net::NicoVideo, instance of this class, is an utility that actually uses
    agent Net::NicoVideo::UserAgent. Therefore we can also use
    Net::NicoVideo::UserAgent to tackle the low level problems.

CONSTRUCTOR
    TODO

ACCESS METHOD
  user_agent
    TODO

  email
    TODO

  password
    TODO

  delay
    TODO

  get_user_agent
    Create an instance of Net::NicoVideo::UserAgent.

  get_email
    Get email that instance has. If it is not defined,
    $ENV{NET_NICOVIDEO_EMAIL} is returned instead.

  get_password
    Get password that the instance has. If it is not defined,
    $ENV{NET_NICOVIDEO_PASSWORD} is returned instead.

FETCH METHOD
    Each methods return Net::NicoVideo::Content class which stored the
    result of having parsed the response. Please see sub classes under
    Net::NicoVideo::Content for detail.

  fetch_thumbinfo(video_id)
    Get an instance of Net::NicoVideo::Content::ThumbInfo for video_id.

  fetch_flv(video_id)
    Get an instance of Net::NicoVideo::Content::Flv for video_id.

  fetch_mylist
    Get an instance of Net::NicoVideo::Content::Mylist for video_id.

  watch_video(video_id)
    Get an instance of Net::NicoVideo::Content::Watch for video_id.

    This means that the agent watches the video, and this behavior is
    required before fetch_video.

  fetch_video(Net::NicoVideo::Content::Flv, @args)
    Get an instance of Net::NicoVideo::Content::Video for video_id taht is
    included Net::NicoVideo::Content::Flv object.

    This method works like as request() method of LWP::UserAgent, in fact,
    it is called.

UTILITY METHOD
  download(video_id, file)
    This is a shortcut to download video that is identified by video_id.

    For busy person, you can download a video by one liner like this:

        $ perl -MNet::NicoVideo -e 'Net::NicoVideo->new->download(@ARGV)' smNNNNNN ./smile.mp4

    Note that it is necessary to set environment variables in advance.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
        NET_NICOVIDEO_EMAIL
        NET_NICOVIDEO_PASSWORD

    These obvious environment variables are effective. If the object has
    each value as its members, priority is given to them.
